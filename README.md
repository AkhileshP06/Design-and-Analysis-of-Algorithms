# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository contains implementations, notes, and resources related to the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Whether you are a student, researcher, or enthusiast in the field of algorithms, you will find valuable content here to enhance your understanding and skills.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the contents of this repository. 

`Algorithms/src` contains the java implementation of basic algorithm designs covered throughout the course. Each file name is self explanatory.

To get started follow these steps . . .

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/AkhileshP06/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms.git```

2. Navigate to the `Algorithms/src` directory:

```cd Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Algorithms/src```

3. Compile the Java files using the following command:

```javac *.java```

4. Run the Java files using the `java` command followed by the name of the Java file without the `.java` extension. For example, to run the `BubbleSort.java` file, use the following command:

```java BubbleSort```

Note: Some Java files may require command-line arguments during runtime. In such cases, the required arguments will be specified in the file's comments & the user will be prompted to enter any and all required arguments.
## Dependencies

This project does not have any external dependencies. However, you need to have Java installed on your machine to compile and run the Java files.
